A simple flowchart generator. Now generate flowcharts, roadmaps, graphs with ease and for free. You can create your roadmap and share it with the community. Or maybe make a to-do list. Or maybe plan your next move. Or maybe connect dots of individual events and study and So on. There are limitless possibilities.

## DOWNLOAD

![usage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/846528c9-63cd-4916-952c-f39fe88fa9f0)
> [!TIP]
> You can now visualize recursive JSON files created by LLM Agents. Use the following prompt to get a recursive JSON :
> ```
> Give me a learning dependency to learn [Put you topic here].
> Give me the output as a nested dictionary in JSON format following the format.
> "topic" : "nested dictionary of topics to learn"
> [This part is optional. You can omit if you want]
> In case of nesting, keep the vertical scale low, reasonable but go as deep as possible,
> creating more nested levels,
> enough for a beginner to know where to start.
> ```
> Then create a JSON file, open the tool, Click Open -> Open a Graph, select the corresponding file.
> Click the "Automatically Arrange Selected Nodes" button (The button situated at the top-right of the menu bar)
