A simple flowchart generator. Now generate flowcharts, roadmaps, graphs with ease and for free. You can create your roadmap and share it with the community. Or maybe make a to-do list. Or maybe plan your next move. Or maybe connect dots of individual events and study and So on. There are limitless possibilities.

> [!WARNING]
> <s>The load/save currently doesnt work perfectly. There are a lot bugs/glitches. There is also a bug when the 2st/3nd slot gets disabled
> when Graph Nodes are instantiated and connections cant be set up on those slots.
> So it is advised that the users save their progress by taking screenshots or records or any other medium.</s>
>
> This is initially resolved. Still users are advised to use alternative besides using the load/save feature.
